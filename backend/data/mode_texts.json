Equivalently, lattice polytopes are intersections of half-planes defined by level sets of forms in the dual lattice:\n$$\\Lambda^\\vee \\subset {(\\mathbb{R}^2)}^\\vee.$$\n\nLet $P\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ denote a lattice polytope.\n\n// Add comments about STRATA",
  "rings": "Consider the triangle [[P2:rings]]. This is the simplest 2D polytope and corresponds to the projective plane.\n\n$\\textbf{The ring associated to a stratum}.$\n\nTo understand the coordinate rings of these polytopes, click on a vertex. The cone around this vertex defines a sub-monoid of the lattice (after translating the vertex to the origin): $$M \\subset \\Lambda.$$Working over a field $k$ we associate to $M$ the $\\textit{monoid ring}$: $$k[M] = \\left\\{\\sum a_i \\chi^{m_i} \\middle| m_i \\in M, a_i \\in k\\right\\}$$where elements are polynomials in $\\chi^m$ for an element $m \\in M$ and multiplication is defined by associativity and exponentiation rules.\n\nNow to each vertex we have an associated ring, and by taking the spectrum of this ring we have an affine variety.\n"
