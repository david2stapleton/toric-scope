  "polytopes": "[title]Welcome![/title]\n\nThe purpose of this site is to give an introduction to toric varieties, and to develop geometric intuition through an interactive 2D-polytope interface.\n\n[[ex-poly-1|Click here]] to load a polytope, and click the lattice points to modify the given polytope.\n\n[title]Intro to polytopes[/title]\n\nA [b]polytope[/b], $\\Pi \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, is the convex hull of finitely many points. Equivalently, a polytope is the intersection of finitely many half planes.\n\nWe restrict our attention to the convex hulls of lattice points, for some lattice $$\\Lambda \\subset \\RR^n$$(also known as [b]lattice polytopes[/b]). Equivalently, lattice polytopes are intersections of half-planes by forms in the dual lattice:$$\\Lambda^\\vee \\subset {(\\mathbb{R}^n)}^\\vee.$$\n\nTo a polytope $\\Pi\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ we associate a partially ordered set of [b]strata[/b]: $$\\Sigma(\\Pi) \\subset \\mathcal{P}(\\Pi).$$Visibly, a stratum is either $\\Pi$ or a polytope on the boundary of $\\Pi$ (in our example, a vertex, edge or face). (Technically a stratum is a polytope which is the convex hull of a subset of extremal vertices.) The example in the lattice has\n\n[center]({{strata}}) = ({{faces}})+({{edges|descr|blink:100}})+({{vertices|descr|blink:100}})+({{|\"1 empty stratum\"}}).[/center]",
  "rings": "[title]The ring associated to a stratum[/title]\n\nFor a [[gerald:rings|polytope]] $\\Pi$ we construct the associated toric variety: $X(\\Pi)$. Working over a field $k$ we associate to any monoid $M$ the [b]monoid ring[/b] associated to $M$ $$k[M] = \\left\\{\\sum a_i \\chi^{m_i} \\middle| m_i \\in M, a_i \\in k\\right\\}$$where elements are polynomials in $\\chi^m$ for an element $m \\in M$ and multiplication is defined by associativity and exponentiation rules.\n\nFor any face (maximal stratum) $f$ of $\\Pi$ define the [b]cone at [/b]$f$ to be the half-space $$C_f(\\Pi) = \\{ w \\in \\RR^n | w \\cdot n_f \\ge 0 \\},$$where $n_f$ is an inner normal vector of $\\Pi$ at $f$. The monoid associated to $f$ ({{edges[0]|\"e.g.\"|select}}) is defined to be $$M(f) = C_f(\\Pi) \\cap \\Lambda \\subset \\Lambda.$$\n\nLikewise, for a stratum $\\sigma \\subset \\Pi$, the cone of $\\Pi$ at $\\sigma$ is$$C_\\sigma(\\Pi)=\\{ w \\in \\RR^n | w \\cdot n_f \\ge 0 \\textrm{ for all } f \\supset \\sigma \\}$$and similarly the monoid associated to $\\sigma$ ({{vertices[0]|\"e.g.\"|select}}) is $$M(\\sigma) = C_\\sigma(\\Pi) \\cap \\Lambda.$$\n\nNow to each stratum we have an associated ring $k[M(\\sigma)]$. Taking the spectrum gives an affine variety$$U(\\sigma) = \\mathrm{Spec}(k[M(\\sigma)]).$$\n\nFinally, if $\\sigma \\le \\tau$, there is a natural inclusion $M(\\sigma)\\subset M(\\tau)$ which defines an open embedding:$$U(\\tau) \\subset U(\\sigma).$$These embeddings glue to our algebraic variety $X(\\Pi)$.\n\n[b]Exercise.[/b] Show that for the polytope [[P2:rings]], each vertex $v \\in \\Pi$ satisfies $$U(v) \\cong \\AA^2.$$\n\n[b]Exercise.[/b] Let $f\\in \\Pi\\subset \\RR^n$ be a maximal stratum. Prove $$k[M(v)] \\cong k[x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}, y^{\\pm 1}].$$\n\n[title]The toric structure[/title]\n\nThere is a natural inclusion $$k[M_v]\\subset k[\\Lambda]\\cong k[x_1^{\\pm 1},\\cdots,x_n^{\\pm 1}].$$The latter is the coordinate ring of the torus $\\GG_m^n$ which corresponds to an open inclusion $\\GG_m^n \\cong \\TT \\subset X_v$.\n\n[b]Exercise.[/b] Show that $\\TT$ naturally acts on $X_v$ and this action respects the inclusion $\\TT \\subset \\GG_m^n$.\n\nImportantly, any [b]monomial[/b] ($\\chi^m$ for $m\\in M_v$) spans the unique 1-dimensional sub-representation $$k\\cdot \\chi^m \\subset k[M_v]$$with weight $-m$.\n\n[b]Lemma.[/b] The rings $k[M(\\sigma)]$ are normal rings.\n\n[b]Proof.[/b] As $k[M(\\sigma)] \\subset k[\\TT]$ we see that $k[M(\\sigma)]$ is an integral domain. It remains to show $k[M(\\sigma)]$ is integrally closed. By the exercise this is true in the case of maximal strata as the varieties are smooth. For other strata, we can describe the coordinate rings as intersections of normal rings, so we are done by the exercise below.\n\n[b]Exercise.[/b] Let $R_1, \\cdots, R_m$ be rings with the same field of fractions $$\\mathrm{Frac(R_1)} = \\mathrm{Frac(R_2)} = \\cdots = \\mathrm{Frac(R_m)}.$$Prove that if the rings $R_i$ are normal, then $R = \\cap R_i$ is normal.\n\n[b]Exercise.[/b] Prove that the toric variety associated to [[P2:rings]] is the projective plane.\n\n[b]Exercise.[/b] Prove that the toric variety of [[P1xP1:rings]] is the product $\\PP^1 \\times \\PP^1$."
