Equivalently, lattice polytopes are intersections of half-planes by forms in the dual lattice:$$\\Lambda^\\vee \\subset {(\\mathbb{R}^2)}^\\vee.$$\n\nTo a polytope $\\Pi\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ we associate a partially ordered set of $\\textit{strata}$: $$\\Sigma(\\Pi) \\subset \\mathcal{P}(\\Pi).$$Visibly, a stratum is either $\\Pi$ or a polytope on the boundary of $\\Pi$ (in our example, a vertex, edge or face). (Technically a stratum is a polytope which is the convex hull of a subset of extremal vertices.) The example in the lattice has\n\n[center]({{strata}}) = ({{faces}})+({{edges|descr|blink:100}})+({{vertices|descr|blink:100}})+({{|\"1 empty stratum\"}}).[/center]",

Taking the spectrum gives an affine variety$$X_v = \\mathrm{Spec}(k[M_v]).$$\n\n$\\textbf{Exercise}$ Show that for the polytope [[P2:rings]], each vertex $v \\in \\Pi$ satisfies $$X_v \\cong \\AA^2.$$\n\n// Define the ring of a general stratum $\\sigma \\subset \\Pi$ (or at least a maximal stratum)\n// show that the toric variety of a maximal stratum is smooth.\n\n$\\textbf{The toric structure}$\n\nThere is a natural inclusion $$k[M_v]\\subset k[\\Lambda]\\cong k[x_1^{\\pm 1},\\cdots,x_n^{\\pm 1}].$$The latter is the coordinate ring of the torus $\\GG_m^n$ which corresponds to an open inclusion $\\GG_m^n \\cong \\TT \\subset X_v$.\n\n$\\mathbf{Exercise.}$ Show that $\\TT$ naturally acts on $X_v$ and this action respects the inclusion $\\TT \\subset \\GG_m^n$.\n\nImportantly, any $\\textit{monomial}$ ($\\chi^m$ for $m\\in M_v$) spans the unique 1-dimensional sub-representation $$k\\cdot \\chi^m \\subset k[M_v]$$with weight $-m$.\n\n$\\textbf{Lemma.}$ The rings $k[M_\\sigma]$ are normal rings.\n\n$\\textit{Proof.}$ As $k[M_v] \\subset k[\\TT]$ we see that $k[M_v]$ is an integral domain. It remains to show $k[M_v]$ is integrally closed.
