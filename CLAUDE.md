# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

toric-scope is an online toric variety visualizer. Toric varieties are geometric objects in algebraic geometry defined by combinatorial data (fans, polytopes). This project aims to provide interactive visualization of these mathematical structures.

## Current Status

This is a new project with minimal code. The repository currently contains only:
- README.md with project description
- LICENSE (MIT)
- Git configuration

## Development Setup

Not yet configured. When setting up the development environment, this section should include:
- How to install dependencies
- How to run the development server
- How to build for production
- How to run tests

## Architecture

To be determined as the project develops. Key architectural decisions to document:
- Frontend framework choice (React, Vue, vanilla JS, etc.)
- 3D rendering library (Three.js, WebGL, etc.)
- Mathematical computation libraries
- Data structures for representing fans, polytopes, and toric varieties
